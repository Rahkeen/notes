Watched a presentation on Claude Code today. Want to explore Claude Skills and figure out how they can improve my workflow.

**Skill ideas:**

- **Learning material skill** - Create an environment for learning new topics that sets me up for success. Include prompting heuristics that guide me toward answers rather than just giving me the solution or doing it for me.

- **Android prototyping workflow** - A skill to quickly scaffold features in sample apps. Would set up the environment and boilerplate code that I normally do manually, speeding up the prototype creation process.

**Currently:**

Chilling and working with Rive. Using this time to connect with and understand the tool. I think Rive is going to be powerful and I'd love to be someone who champions it at the company.

Investigating an opportunity to clean up the small stepper animation - it looks really wonky right now and could use some polish.

**Documentation work:**

- Working on documentation for our hosted Figma plugins that designers can use
- Also documenting AI tools available to designers

**iOS Sandbox:**

Brett asked me to help revamp the iOS sandbox application. Going to spend some time today looking at it so I can help resolve some issues he's running into.

**Completed:**

- Finished v0 of the Figma IDS plugin documentation. It's rough around the edges but provides a starting point - will get feedback from the team and add follow-ups.

**Thinking about for tomorrow:**

- Stepper changes - fix the animation (got to this today, want to continue)
- Miranda's ask - update component to allow an icon in the section titles leading slot
- Help improve the iOS sandbox for AI prototyping - good opportunity while also working on AI tools documentation
- Start with decoding work, then move to landscape documentation

Had 3 interviews today - was kinda nuts but made it through.

**Priorities:**

- Fill out interview scorecards for the remaining candidates - tackle this first thing
- Investigate the button height bug pointed out in the Android thread - fix if possible
- Try to fix the stepper issue before diving into AI documentation

Fixed an issue with the price inset button today. It's currently out of spec, but we're not prioritizing component updates at the moment - will revisit later.

**Tomorrow priorities:**

- Dive into AI documentation - get a basic setup going in Figma around Cursor, Claude Code, Figma Make, etc.
- Continue with the stepper animation bug - want to see if AI can help work through what the animation should be, then try re-implementing it in the actual component
- If time permits: keep working on Rive things OR start the Joy of React course to get acclimated to web stuff

**AI exploration goals:**

- Prioritize working with AI to build solid animations and see how it can construct components
- Explore using AI as a teaching tool - have it deep dive on concepts by writing code and walking me through it
