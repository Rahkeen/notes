I generated a list of project to help get me started

**Vector Drawing & Design Fundamentals**

_Project 1: Geometric Icon Set_ Create 3-4 simple icons using only basic shapes - think a house, star, heart, and arrow. This gets you comfortable with the pen tool, shape combinations, boolean operations, and working with fills and strokes. Keep them flat and simple for now.

_Project 2: Gradient Sphere_ Design a 3D-looking sphere using only gradients and circles. This teaches you about radial gradients, layering, and how to create depth without actual 3D tools. Try making it look like a Pokeball or a simple planet.

_Project 3: Character Face_ Build a simple character face with separate elements - eyes, mouth, eyebrows. Don't animate yet, just design it modularly so each part is on its own layer/artboard. This teaches you organizational skills and thinking about how designs will need to move later.

**Basic Animation**

_Project 4: Bouncing Ball_ The classic animation exercise. A ball drops, squashes on impact, and bounces back up. This teaches you keyframe timing, easing curves, and the principles of squash and stretch. Make it feel weighty.

_Project 5: Loading Spinner_ Create a circular loading animation that loops seamlessly. This teaches you about rotation animations, loop timing, and creating infinite animations. Try making it feel smooth and organic rather than mechanical.

_Project 6: Toggle Switch_ Design a toggle that smoothly transitions between on/off states. The knob slides, maybe the background color changes, perhaps add a subtle bounce at the end. This introduces you to state-based thinking before you get into state machines.

**Bones & Rigging**

_Project 7: Waving Hand_ Create a simple hand that waves using bones. Each finger should have joints that bend naturally. This is your introduction to skeletal rigging and parent-child relationships in bone hierarchies.

_Project 8: Swinging Pendulum_ Build a pendulum or hanging lamp that sways realistically. Use bones and constraints to create natural motion. This teaches you about physics-based movement and constraint systems.

**State Machines & Interactivity**

_Project 9: Hover Button_ Create a button with multiple states - idle, hover, pressed, and disabled. Use a state machine to transition between them smoothly. Add subtle animations like scale changes, color shifts, or glow effects for each state.

_Project 10: Like Button Animation_ Build a heart button that animates when clicked - maybe it scales up, changes color, adds particles, then settles. This combines state machines with more complex animation sequences and teaches you about one-shot vs looping animations.

**Advanced Polish**

_Project 11: Glowing Orb_* Create an energy orb with a pulsing glow effect, internal particle movement, and color cycling. This teaches you about blend modes, opacity animations, and creating atmospheric effects.

_Project 12: Morphing Shape_* Build a shape that smoothly morphs between 2-3 different forms (circle to square to triangle). This teaches you about path interpolation and creating smooth transitions between very different states.

**Bringing It Together**

_Project 13: Animated Weather Icon_ Create a weather icon that transitions between states - sun to cloud to rain. Combine everything you've learned: vector design, bones for movement, state machines for transitions, and polish effects like the rain drops and sun rays.

**Then: Boulder Badge** By this point, you'll have the skills to tackle the badge. You'll know how to design the rock shapes, rig them for subtle floating movement, add that anime-style glow effect, and make it interactive with state machines.

# 01. Icon Set

[Claude Chat](https://claude.ai/share/3271cd86-208c-4d42-b607-295979cbaa76)

## Standards
- **Icon bounds:** 24x24px
- **Safe area:** 20x20px (2px padding)
- **Style:** Consistent rounded aesthetic

## Icons to Build
1. Home
2. Star
3. Envelope
4. Cloud
5. Search
6. Heart

## Techniques to Practice
- Pen tool (custom paths, anchor points, bezier curves)
- Shape tools (rectangle, circle, polygon/star)
- Stroke properties (weight, caps, joins)
- Fill management
- Layering and hierarchy
- Path editing and vertex manipulation
- Optical centering

## Important Note
Rive has limited vector editing tools compared to dedicated design software like Figma. No boolean operations (union, subtract, intersect). Work within these constraints - focus on learning animation capabilities over complex vector editing.

Played around with combining shapes
Played around with the pen tool
Created a shape with multiple paths (though all paths must have the same fill / stroke)
