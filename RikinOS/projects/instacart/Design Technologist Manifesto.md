### **What is a Design Technologist?**

A Design Technologist bridges the gap between design exploration and technical reality. We take rough ideas and turn them into functional, interactive prototypes that help teams make better decisions. We work in code because that's where designs truly come to life—where interactions feel real, transitions have weight, and ideas can be tested in their native environment.

We're not traditional engineers building production systems, nor are we designers who dabble in code. We're specialists in **making ideas tangible quickly**, with a focus on craft, experimentation, and enabling the design process.

### **What We Focus On**

**1. Functional Prototyping**

- Building interactive prototypes that go beyond static mockups
- Exploring transitions, animations, and interactions in real environments
- Helping designers see and feel components in context before committing to production

**2. Design Tooling & Infrastructure**

- Creating Figma plugins and workflow tools that improve designer productivity
- Building sample projects, templates, and starter kits for rapid exploration
- Developing native design tools (like Play for iOS) that let designers work closer to the final medium

**3. Component Exploration & Validation**

- Prototyping new design system components to validate feasibility and feel
- Testing edge cases and interaction patterns before they reach production
- Helping designers think through component behavior in functional terms

**4. Platform-Native Experiences**

- Building prototypes that feel native to their platform (Android, iOS, web)
- Understanding platform conventions and helping designs respect them
- Meeting designers where they work, across mobile and web

### **How We're Different**

**Design Technologist vs. Design System Engineer:**

A design system engineer focuses on **production-ready, scalable component libraries**—code that ships to users, with performance, accessibility, and maintenance as priorities.

A design technologist focuses on **exploration and enablement**—rapid prototyping, tooling, and validation that happens _before_ production. We help answer "should we build this?" and "how should this feel?" rather than "how do we scale this?"

We're upstream from production, working in the messy, creative phase where ideas are still forming.

### **Core Values**

- **High craftsmanship**: Understanding what looks and feels good, even if we're not designers by title
- **Speed over perfection**: Functional prototypes that inform decisions, not production-ready code
- **Designer enablement**: Building tools and systems that let designers work more effectively
- **Platform fluency**: Meeting designers in their medium, whether that's mobile, web, or emerging platforms

**In short**: Design Technologists make ideas real, fast. We prototype, we build tools, and we help designers explore what's possible—all with an obsession for craft and quality.
