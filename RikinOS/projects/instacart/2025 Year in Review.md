Self Review Questions:
1. In which Instacart core competency do you demonstrate the most strength? 
2. In which Instacart core competency do you demonstrate an opportunity to grow?

My greatest strength in 2025 was **Solves Creatively**, demonstrated through my work building infrastructure and learning resources for AI prototyping. This was a highly ambiguous initiative aimed at enabling designers to integrate AI into their workflows. As the technical resource in our weekly working group, I focused on **reducing friction** and making these tools accessible. My contributions included:

 **Building Playground Projects**: I developed cross-platform template repositories (iOS, Android, Web) that served as functional starting points. This was a primary way to reduce friction, letting designers worry less about technical details and more about building.

  This aligns with **Honing our Craft** by building tools that meaningfully shape project direction and unblock team-wide bottlenecks.
  
**Connecting Cursor w/ Figma**: I built a workflow integrating Cursor with the Figma MCP, allowing AI to reference design files. Designers could have a frame selected and ask Vursor to reference it directly. I helped build rules that better utilized the integration and guidelines to use it effectively. 
  
  This is a clear example of **Inspiring Perspectives** by driving an integrated design-technical solution that connects dots across systems.
  
**Creating Learning Resources**: I translated complex technical concepts into clear guidelines and presentations. We did a few onboarding sessions, and even did a session with a PM learning group to help facilitate a hackathon of sorts. 

This showcases the **Hone our Craft** competency of making complex design-technical concepts accessible to the broader team.

All of this work culminated in a 90-minute workshop at the **D&R Summit**. I helped lead the session and served as a TA, providing a space for designers to dive into these tools with real projects. The workshop was a success, inspiring many designers to adopt AI-assisted prototyping and continue building afterwords.
