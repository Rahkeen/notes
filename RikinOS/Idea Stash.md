### Floating Components on Water - Android Onboarding Prototype
An onboarding screen where UI components (input fields, buttons) appear to float on water. The background is a shader-powered water simulation. When users interact with components, they bounce slightly and cause ripples in the water behind them.

**Why build this:** Demonstrates the power of code-configurable shaders over static video backgrounds—the water reacts dynamically to actual user input rather than just playing a looped animation.
