# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is an Obsidian vault for personal notes and learning materials.

## Structure

- **TODO.txt.md** - Daily thought dump and notes (dated entries with format `2025-12-3`)
- **Top-level .md files** - Courses and learning materials (Joy of React, Learning Rive, etc.)
- **assets/** - Images and media
- **templates/** - Obsidian templates

## Working with This Vault

- Notes use standard markdown with Obsidian-specific features (wikilinks `[[Note Name]]`, canvas files)
- TODO.txt.md is a running log - new entries go at the bottom with a date header
