### Main Points
My current state of the world
- Really good salary + equity upside
- Doing what I want (kinda)
- Lot's of friends where I work
- Not so many people hiring

**Why leave?**
- I'm not happy
- I'm not motivated
- I want to build something for myself
- I want the flexibility to jump on opportunities

**My time at big companies**
- Experience can vary greatly depending on your team and manager, which are not always in your control
	- Past 2 years I've had 9 managers across 2 teams and multiple re-orgs
		- Ryan, Harry, Ankur, Zen, Sophia, Stef, Gordon, XianXing, Yan
	- Building a relationship with your manager takes time and if you realize you don't work well together it will have a large impact on your career
- The past 6 months have been empty
	- I've really not had a lot to work on
	- That in and of itself was draining and I felt like i still couldn't really focus on side projects

**What's next?**
I'm an Android developer at heart, and I have always wanted to help grow the Indie Android developer community. I'll be making a bunch of exciting Android applications and releasing them to the Play Store. I also love to build experiments that push the boundaries of Android with things like animations, physics, GL shaders, and much more. I'll be sharing content around my learnings and projects that I build, so follow me on Twitter, Mastodon, and Youtube so you don't miss out!

### What do I want to get across?
- I don't quite fit at a big company like Pinterest
	- Managers
	- Promotion
	- Fulfillment
- I want to build things for me
- I want to fully utilize my best skills
- I'm inspired by @snokbert and @sinamaski and @saket

### Draft

I'm quit my job at Pinterest last week to work on my own ideas full-time. I'm leaving a lot of money on the table and a stable income in a time of economic uncertainty. It's a big risk, but I'm confident this is the right move and I want to share why.

#### Wants vs. Needs

I joined Pinterest in 2018 as an Android Engineer. I was relatively new and was excited to work with and learn from some really talented people. For a while it was fun, it was new, I was growing and felt excited to come to work and build things. 

One thing I realized quickly was that I am definitively a technologist. I loved Android development, and loved deeply learning about all it's nooks and crannies. I wanted to use the latest APIs, update our architectural patterns, and write some great Android code. I mostly worked on product teams, however, which meant that my core responsibility was iterating quickly on product features and running experiments. Because of this, I felt like at times I was pushed to just write quick code instead of really getting to build something I was proud of.

Product Engineering also started to feel like repetition of the same skills over and over. 
- Build a feature quickly 
- Run an experiment and see if that feature moved any important metrics
- Ship, shutdown, or iterate on that feature 
- (Optional or Never) Refactor code and pay down incurred tech debt
After some time it didn't feel rewarding to finish a project. I just built it and then it was on to the next one. And to be fair, for the teams I was working on, a lot of times writing quick code was arguably the right strategy. Why spend a lot of time building something that might not even ship. It just didn't feel good to me, it's not what I wanted to do.

After a few years I was experienced in the Android codebase at Pinterest and had a decent product building skillset. I started to get some opportunties to mentor and teach some newer Engineers and I loved it. It was challenging but super rewarding getting to uplevel engineers technically and impart some of my own personal opinions on how to write good Android code. I even got the opportunity to take on an apprentice at my current team
