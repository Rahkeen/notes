I got a lot done this morning personally:
- Went for a run
- Did the dishes
- Opened up Todo's before starting work
- Trying for the millionth time to take notes effectively

## Work Things
Checking w/ Yan + Gordon
- Converted View Animations to a format supported by OpenGl
- Aggregated View + Export animation code so that it was using the same core logic to drive animation
- Updated creation logic to allows for scrubbing through animation to be in line with what it will look like when exported
Next Steps
- There may be a few inconsistencies with the animation before + after export so have to document those issues and sort them out before we start an experiment
- Formally expand this system for text blocks
- Update the modal UI
- Add more animations / make them consistent with iOS animations

	Still feels like they don't have confidence in what I am doing.
