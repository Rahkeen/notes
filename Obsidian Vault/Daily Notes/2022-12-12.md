## Work

Thinking about gating the Overlay transitions, a few things to think about:
- Make sure that overlay transitions only apply to stickers on video pages
- There has been some code modified that is not gated, but should still preseve the control experience. Should we gate that?
- Since we are persisting transitions, we may need to make sure that if we turn off the experiment, that the transitions get reset to the default (INSTANT)

Show Overlay Transitions UI for only Stickers on Video Pages

### Thought Dump
There is a bug when you are on the Duration Fragment and you are updating other stickers. All the transitions kinda get reset. We should look into this

Just want to map out the structural changes for the sticker overlay transition experiment, and what things need to be gated vs what things can just structurally change the logic?

When do we show the transtion selection UI
- sticker block supports transitions
- sticker block is on a video page
- in experiment for overlay transitions

I introduced a bug for non-sticker elements, so I should update duration times accross the board so that when drawing we don't get shafted.
