So far trying to use Obsidian daily is tough, but taking notes is a developed skill, one that I did very poorly before even when it was important, like college.

Gonna try and be a bit better about it, and the first step is to at least dump some notes in an editor

Next steps are to create a process around reviewing / curating the notes into a better organized system

Third is to actually learn the tool a bit better and utilize some more power user features

K, let's take some notes.
